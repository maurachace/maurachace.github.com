Am I...blogging again?

Let me explain.

This year I decided to get rid of my general-purpose webhosting with [WebFaction]. I like WebFaction and would still recommend them to anyone, but over time I ended up just hosting WordPress blogs there, which is silly. I moved my blogs to WordPress.com with domain mapping, which I recommend because you let their great team worry about plugins, themes and upgrades, and it's cheaper overall.

## But

I needed a place to host maurachace.com, my (personal/professional?) home page. At first, I tried *really* hard to use a service like [Flavors.me] or [About.me]. Beyond a few niggles, the deal breaker for both was that I couldn't delegate an OpenID provider. Okay, I know OpenID is dead, but I didn't like having my hands tied.

## So

I turned to [GitHub Pages][ghb]. It gave me all of the customization I wanted, and you can CNAME your own domain for free. Although I wasn't planning on using it at first, it comes with [Jekyll], "a blog-aware, static site generator," built in. How awesome this is started to sink in, and I read a few posts about the ease of using Jekyll (below), so I decided to give it a try.
