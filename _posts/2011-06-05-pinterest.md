When you need something, ask the internet. A little over a month ago I [sent out the call][tweet] that I wanted a Pinterest invite. (And thanks to my awesome friends who responded.) Originally I figured it would be the perfect service to collect [recipes] I wanted to make. If you don't know, Pinterest is basically a photo bookmarking site, with each bookmark referred to as a pin.

## Things I like

The visual aspect is clearly what Pinterest is all about, and it does it pretty well. The site's design is minimal, with a cool liquid layout to give you the most photos for your screen real estate. Pinterest's community features are key; it's not nearly as fun without an actively pinning set of friends. The ability to repin others' pins is key, and I often find myself looking for cool stuff *on* Pinterest rather than the internets at large.

## Things I don't like

I don't really get why having both a like and a repin feature are necessary. I have "liked" pins when I don't have an appropriate board to pin them to...but still. I don't like when you repin it will take the original description with it without attribution by default...making it look like you wrote it. This is just a personal feature request, but I hate that there are no private boards, because they'd be an awesome way to collect gift ideas.

## What I didn't expect

* I figured Pinterest would be full of food, fashion and home decorating ideas and primarily cater to women. While I'm guessing women hold some majority, men seem to like it, too.
* I made a pinboard of [puppies] to brighten my day.
* As the data set grows, there's going to be some really interesting data mining-type things they can do (and hopefully via API as well).
* [They use Django][jobs]!
