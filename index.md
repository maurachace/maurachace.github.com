# Maura Chace Kelly

I live in in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm a developer and manager. In my previous role, I managed the innovation lab for Cox Media Group, a program for self-directed projects similar to Google 20% time.

I love [Django][] and Python, JSON, clean, usable design, best practices and Macs. I graduated from [The University of Tennessee, Knoxville][UT], with a degree in computer science. I enjoy running and cooking.
